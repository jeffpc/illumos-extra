    Implement -fstrict-calling-conventions
    
    Stock GCC is overly willing to violate the ABI when calling local functions,
    such that it passes arguments in registers on i386.  This hampers debugging
    with anything other than a fully-aware DWARF debugger, and is generally not
    something we desire.
    
    Implement a flag which disables this behaviour, enabled by default.  The flag is
    global, though only effective on i386, to more easily allow its globalization
    later which, given the odds, is likely to be necessary.
